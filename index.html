        <h3>Why Health is Important?</h3>
        <div class="health-cont">
        <div class="health-content">
            <p>Health is one of the most valuable assets in life. It influences how we feel, think, and function on a daily basis. Good health allows individuals to lead active, productive lives and better handle stress and challenges. Whether it's performing well at work, enjoying quality time with family and friends, or simply having the energy to pursue hobbies, maintaining physical and mental well-being is essential.

Being healthy goes beyond just the absence of illness — it means having a body and mind that function optimally. Regular exercise, a balanced diet, adequate sleep, and stress management are all important parts of a healthy lifestyle. Preventive care, such as routine checkups and self-monitoring, plays a crucial role in staying ahead of potential health issues.

A key indicator of physical health is heart rate, which is the number of times your heart beats per minute (bpm). It provides insights into how efficiently your heart is working. A normal resting heart rate for adults typically ranges from 60 to 100 bpm. Monitoring your heart rate can help detect abnormalities and assess your fitness level.

Taking care of your health today ensures a better, stronger tomorrow. It’s an ongoing journey that builds a foundation for a longer, happier life.</p>
